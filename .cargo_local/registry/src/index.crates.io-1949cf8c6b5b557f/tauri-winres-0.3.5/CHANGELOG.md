## \[0.3.0]

- `winres` is now more strict about `embed_resource`'s result (using manifest_required instead of manifest_option) and therefore may panic more likely, for example if the environment is missing a resource compiler.

- Use https://github.com/nabijaczleweli/rust-embed-resource to compile the resource for better cross-platform compilation support. Note that because of this a few methods are no-op now and marked as deprecated. Technically this was a breaking change.
